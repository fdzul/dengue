I was pretty sure there was more, and I just remembered what they were:

- Seed RNG, generate the serotype sequence, and re-seed.  This will make the simulation
  independent of the length of the serotype sequence generated, in case we want to generate
  more years than we will use in ABC

- Check the status of the 8-14 year olds on April 10, 1987, not December 31, 1986

And to recap the other stuff:

- Run with only non-negative numbers of mosquitoes

- Add 100 days at the end, to finish on April 9, outputting serotypes, mosquitoes, and
  immunity

- Turn off the weird carrying capacity but not bit with infected mosquitoes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TH to JRCP, CABP

More abc-to-do notes:

- Consider seasonally (not annually) varying EIP, as this is already implemented and I have
  the temp data, but we haven't tried it because we never looked at whether the seasonality
  was good before.

- Impose serotypes for 35 year period, sample from conditional distributions to get
  serotypes before and after the window we know about.

- Add autocorrelation coefficients as metrics.

- Consider adding quartiles as metrics, possibly taking out maximum (one of Aaron King's
  suggestions).

- Probably don't bother refitting serotype model to integrate over all possibly serotypes
  circulating in missing years, because that would make the second bullet above a pita.

Something to consider:

Immunity swapping and vaccination both should occur during the "off-season."  It's
definitely weird, I think, to vaccinate and then immediately age the population.  That would
mean that in the year immediately following vaccination, the number of vaccinated people
would be different from the number of doses administered.

Currently, vaccinations happen on Julian day 100 (day 99 of the simulator, if the simulator
starts on Jan 1), while immunity swapping occurs on simulator-year day 364, or when
simulator day + 1 % 365 == 0.  So . . . we should decide something, and then do it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CABP to TJH, JRCP

Wait, the write up said immunity swapping occurred in off season as well?  I agree with
making it happen then - the argument for then was very sensible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional note from conversations today:

Our mosquito seasonality currently gives special treatment to infected mosquitoes: when a
location's capacity decreases (e.g. at end of rainy season), susceptible mosquitoes are
implicitly killed off, but infectious mosquitoes are allowed to finish a normal lifespan.
Aside from being inconsistent, this is potentially the cause of (or a contributor to) the
lag observed in the simulated seasonal epidemic curve, as compared to the empirical curve.
At the end of Infectious mosquitoes should be killed off with probability 1 - min(k_2/k_1,
1.0) [corrected from original email by JRCP], where k_2 is the new months multiplier and k_1
is last months multiplier.  In months where capacity increases, nothing happens to infected
mosquitoes because the additional cap space is filled with susceptible mosquitoes.

### JRCP to TJH, CABP

C and I also came up w another issue, that I think should be addressed with these changes.
Seems that in the 'DDT period' case introductions stop but mosquito populations aren't
affect. This seems the opposite of what one would expect to occur biologically - where you
would expect the same number (or possibly lower, but not zero) of introductions, with
limited (or approximately 0) subsequent transmission (because mosquito numbers have dropped
dramatically. The new version of the incidence figure highlights the consequences of the way
it's currently modeled vs the more plausible version: during the DDT period, number of cases
dip gradually instead of dipping more suddenly and then gradually rebounding (which is what
you would expect, if you have introductions but 'no' local transmission - population level
immunity would decline through time some more introductions would be 'successful'). How
difficult would it be to implement so that the DDT periods gets introductions but has
limited or no mosquito capacity?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TH to JRCP, CABP

If DDT was applied throughout the region, then it should affect both mosquitoes and
introductions.  Currently, however, I have no hard info about any of that.  Maybe I can ask
Diana to look into this, since sources may well be in Spanish.  Yesterday Ira asked me if
the paper could be done in a month.  I told him I didn't think it would quite be ready to
submit, but I don't think we're so far from that anymore.  The real problem is that I just
haven't had time to sit down and focus on making these changes, and with the Cuba thing
coming up and Carl going back to Ghana, the next few weeks don't look awesome.  If these
changes don't happen before 8/22, they will become the priority at that point.
